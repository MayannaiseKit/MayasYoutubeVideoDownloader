Hello!

There is a few issues with this release. Please understand I'm really bad at this and I'm trying to get better!
If you're getting an error with PIL just run cmd in the folder and type: "pip install pillow". If that doesn't work please install Python and if you have and it claims pip doesn't exist please install pip!

Anyways don't steal my work, credit me. And have fun with your new youtube videos or sum...
